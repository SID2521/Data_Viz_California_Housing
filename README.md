# Data_Viz_California_Housing
The Tableau dashboard visualizes California housing prices, categorizing them by ocean proximity (<1H OCEAN, INLAND, ISLAND, NEAR BAY, NEAR OCEAN). The vertical axis represents house values, while a color gradient indicates median house values ranging from low to high. Geographical data is plotted on a map using latitude and longitude. The visualization integrates median income data, showing the influence of income on housing patterns. The color-coded scheme allows for a quick understanding of how median house values vary across different ocean proximities. Overall, the dashboard offers a comprehensive insight into the complex relationship between location, median income, and housing values in California as of 2023.
